// Regression test: spread correction must target the MARKET, not the rail.
//
// Production incident (a live market-pair bot, 292-slot rail, ~0.3%/slot):
// the live SELL window occupied slots 156-175 (best sell 1071.2) while 116
// empty sell slots lay above it, out to the grid ceiling at ~1605. Spread
// correction fired twice in one evening and created
//   1.7.574990982  sell slot-291 @ 1605.17
//   1.7.574991281  sell slot-290 @ 1600.36
// Neither order could narrow the spread by a single tick — both sat ~50%
// ABOVE bestSell — and the next full resync cancelled both as surplus
// ("Startup: Cancelled stale surplus SELL order"), so the resync existed only
// to clean up after the correction path.
//
// Two independent defects combined to produce this:
//
//   1. `sortCandidates` had two branches (windowFirst when the rail had live
//      orders, edgeFirst otherwise) that were written as exact OPPOSITES. The
//      SELL/windowed branch sorted DESCENDING and so resolved to the grid
//      ceiling. The two rails are not symmetric here: empty slots always sit
//      on the FAR side of the live window, so market-nearest and
//      window-adjacent are the SAME slot and one comparator serves both.
//
//   2. The merge order led with the rail-wide orphan pool, which was capped at
//      missingSlots on its own. With missingSlots=1 it consumed the entire
//      quota, so the gap-band promotion path — the only candidate kind that
//      can actually tighten the measured spread — was never even asked.
//
// The third guard (tightensSpread) is what makes the ceiling structurally
// unreachable rather than merely sorted last: sorting alone still resolves to
// the first empty slot PAST the window, which is on the wrong side of the
// live best price.
